## We fork archived/abandoned purescript packages and publish to package-sets with prefix `open-` (ask for invitation any member). 

like purescript-contrib, but maximally lenient! (reviews are not required, we believe each other)

# Rules:

1. EVERYONE are owners of this organization! To invite someone new - https://github.com/orgs/purescript-open-community/people . ANYONE can invite ANYONE, everyone are `admins`
2. commit whatever You want
3. `spago publish`
